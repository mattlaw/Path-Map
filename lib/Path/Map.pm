=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $mapper = Path::Map->new(
        '/x/y/z' => 'XYZ',
        '/a/b/c' => 'ABC',
        '/a/b'   => 'AB',

        '/date/:year/:month/:day' => 'Date',

        # Every path beginning 'SEO' is mapped the same.
        '/seo/*' => 'slurpy',
    );

    if (my $match = $mapper->lookup('/date/2013/12/25')) {
        # $match->handler is 'Date'
        # $match->variables is { year => 2012, month => 12, day => 25 }
    }

    # Add more mappings later
    $mapper->add_handler($path => $target)

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class maps paths to handlers. The paths can contain variable path
segments, which match against any incoming path segment, where the matching
segments are saved as named variables for later retrieval.

Note that the handlers being mapped to can be any arbitrary data, not just
strings as illustrated in the synopsis.

=head2 Comparison with Path::Router

This class fulfills some of the same jobs as L<Path::Router>, with slightly
different design goals. Broadly speaking, Path::Map is a lighter, faster,
but less featureful version of Path::Router.

I've listed a few points of difference here to help highlight the pros and
cons of each class.

=over

=item Speed

The main goal for Path::Map is lookup speed. Path::Router uses regexes to
do lookups, but Path::Map uses hash lookups. Path::Map seems to be at
least an order of magnitude faster based on my benchmarks, and performance
doesn't degrade with the number of routes that are added. The main source of
performance degradation for Path::Map is path I<depth>, Path::Router
degrades less with depth but more with width.

This approach also means that the order in which routes are added makes no
difference to Path::Map.

=item Reversibility

Path::Router has a specific aim of being reversible. That is to say you can
construct a path from a set of parameters. Path::Map does not currently
have this ability, patches welcome!

=item Validation

Path::Map has no built-in ability to validate path variables in any way.
Obviously validation can be done externally after the fact, but that doesn't
allow for the more complex routing rules possible in Path::Router.

In other words, it's not possible for Path::Map to differentiate two path
templates which differ only in the variable segments (e.g. C<< /blog/:name >>
vs C<< /blog/:id >> where C<id> matches C<\d+> and C<name> matches C<\D+>).

=item Dependencies

Path::Map has a very small dependency chain, whereas Path::Router is based
on L<Moose>, so has a relatively high dependency footprint. If you're already
using Moose, there's obviously no additional cost in using Path::Router.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new

    $mapper = $class->new(@pairs)

The constructor.

Takes an even-sized list and passes each pair to L</add_handler>.

=cut

sub new {
    my $class = shift;
    my $self = bless {}, $class;

    my $iterator = natatime 2, @_;
    while (my @pair = $iterator->()) {
        $self->add_handler(@pair);
    }

    return $self;
}

=head2 add_handler

    $mapper->add_handler($path_template, $handler)

Adds a single item to the mapping.

The path template should be a string comprising slash-delimited path segments,
where a path segment may contain any character other than the slash. Any
segment beginning with a colon (C<:>) denotes a mandatory named variable.
Empty segments, including those implied by leading or trailing slashes are
ignored.

For example, these are all identical path templates:

    /a/:var/b
    a/:var/b/
    //a//:var//b//

The order in which these templates are added has no bearing on the lookup,
except that later additions with identical templates overwrite earlier ones.

Templates containing a segment consisting entirely of C<'*'> match instantly
at that point, with all remaining segments assigned to the C<values> of the
match as normal, but without any variable names. Any remaining segments in the
template are ignored, so it only makes sense for the wildcard to be the last
segment.

    my $map = Path::Map->new('foo/:foo/*' => 'Something');
    my match = $map->lookup('foo/bar/baz/qux');
    $match->variables; # { foo => 'bar' }
    $match->values; # [ qw( bar baz qux ) ]

=cut

sub add_handler {
    my ($self, $path, $handler) = @_;
    my $class = ref $self;

    my @parts = $self->_tokenise_path($path);
    my (@vars, $slurpy);
    my $mapper = reduce {
        $b =~ s{^:(.*)}{/} and push @vars, $1;
        $b eq '*' and $slurpy = 1;
        $slurpy ? $a : $a->_map->{$b} ||= $class->new;
    } $self, @parts;

    $mapper->_set_target($handler);
    $mapper->_set_variables(\@vars);
    $mapper->_set_slurpy if $slurpy;

    return;
}

=head2 lookup

    $match = $mapper->lookup($path)

Returns a L<Path::Map::Match> object if the path matches a known path
template, C<undef> otherwise.

The two main methods on the match object are:

=over

=item handler

The handler that was matched, identical to whatever was originally passed to
L</add_handler>.

=item variables

The named path variables as a hashref.

sub lookup {
    my ($mapper, $path) = @_;

    while () {
        if ($mapper->_is_slurpy) {
            $slurpy_match = Path::Map::Match->new(
                mapper => $mapper,
                values => [ @values, @parts ],
            );
        }

        if (my $segment = shift @parts) {
            my $map = $mapper->_map;

            my $next;
            if ($next = $map->{$segment}) {
                # Nothing
            }
            elsif ($next = $map->{'/'}) {
                push @values, $segment;
            }
            elsif ($slurpy_match) {
                return $slurpy_match;
            }
            else {
                return undef;
            }

            $mapper = $next;
        }
        elsif (defined $mapper->_target) {
            return Path::Map::Match->new(
                mapper => $mapper,
                values => \@values
            );
        }
        else {
            return undef;
        }
    }
}

=head2 handlers

    @handlers = $mapper->handlers()

Returns all of the handlers in no particular order.
